# Trend Health
- Single Page React Web Application, hosted on heroku via an express server; data posts and pulls required for the application are made via communication with an MLab Mongo database. 

**ABOUT THIS APP** 
- Trend Health is a stock market trend monitoring system. The system generates scoring metrics by analyzing the price history and technical indicators of a given stock or sector (ETF), applies a user-defined weighting for each of the scoring metrics, and outputs a "Trend Health". 

(For an in depth explanation of the scoring system, please see the white paper avilable at Trend Health's About page.)

- In order for the user to access the watchlist page and update their user settings, they must create an account. Without an account, only the sector page is available for viewing, with default User Settings. All accounts created are encrypted via BCryptJS. 

- In the user settings, there are two selections to be made. 1) The "fast" moving average, and the "slow" moving average. 2) The weightings to be applied to the scoring metrics. Once these settings are confirmed (modified from their default settings, or retained), the user may visit the watchlist and sector pages.

- The sector page displays nine sub sectors of the stock market that are actively followed in investing and "FinTwit (Financial Twitter)" communities. Their Trend Healths are generated using the most actively traded ETFs for that sector. 

- The watchlist page displays a table of user defined stocks that they wish to track Trend Healths for. They can add and remove stocks from the table with ease. 

- Price Data for both the Sector and Watchlist pages are updated Weekly on Fridays at 18:00 Eastern Standard time. Weekly data pulls are fitting due to the usage of weekly closing prices for price and technical indicator data. 

**Server and Client Side Dependencies**
*Server Side*
- Data required for the app is stored in an MLab database via Heroku. Communications to and from the database are made using Mongoose. 
- BCryptJS in coordination with .json Web Token, and JWT-Decode are required for user authentication. JWT Decode is used to decrypt the user's Json Web Token. 
- CORS is required for providing Express middleware

*Client Side*
- React scripts for starting up the client/development server. 
- React router for serving up pages of the application to the DOM, and hitting API routes. 
- React Table, Bootstrap for styling, in coordination with Material UI. 

- Medium Zoom for displaying images on the About page

- Axios and Jquery (AJAX) for promise based asynchronous calls to the AlphaVantage, and Trend Health APIs.

- Cron for sheduling specified times in which data is pulled from the Alpha Vantage API and updated in the MLab Database.

**Purpose of this app**
- This app was a team's final project for the UNC Chapelhill Full Stack Coding Bootcamp, it was fundamental in solidifying the programmers' (Thomas Coughlin, David Chan Ho, Patrick ONeill, and Logan McNulty) knowledge of working with and building full stack react applications. 

**Future Enhancements of the application**
- Some team members plan on maintaining the application in the future. Future enhancements in the pipeline for implementation include: additional user settings (lookback for moving average slope, MACD. Daily/monthly periodicity availability, additional technical indicators), additional fundamental/technical data in the user watchlist table, customized sector page with additional fundamental and technical sector information, dark mode, and more!
